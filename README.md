# Time_Series_Analysis
# Experiment 1:
1)  Detecting trends using Hodrick -Prescott Filter
2)  Detrending a Time Series(Pandas,Signal, HP filter)
# Experiment 2: Seasonality
1) Multiple Box Plots
2) Autocorrelation Plot
3) Deseasoning of Time-Series Data
4) Seasonal Decomposition(Additive and Multiplicative)
   i.Trend
   ii.Seasonal Index
   iii.Residual
5) Detecting Cyclic Variations
# Experiment 3: Implementation of Data Wrangling and Preparation for Time Series Data.
# Experiment 5: Making Data Stationary: Plots, Summary Statistics, Statistics Unit Root Tests, Augmented Dickey â€“Fuller Test.
# Experiment 6: Comparative Analysis of Autoregressive,Moving AverageandAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average on a given dataset.
